"""Day 14 · Trust but verify

A model read 10 invoices and gave back JSON (see OUTPUTS below). Some of it is great, some is broken,
and some looks fine but the maths doesn't add up. Your code decides what goes into the database
and what a person has to check.

No API key needed. Run `python quest.py 14` after each TODO.
