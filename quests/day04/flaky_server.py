"""Day 4 · The flaky server

call_with_retry(fn) calls fn() and, when it fails for a reason that might go away, tries again
after waiting a little longer each time.

Two kinds of errors (already defined for you):
  TransientError  - a timeout or a 503. Worth retrying.
  PermanentError  - a 400 or a 404. Retrying won't fix it, so fail at once.

Run `python quest.py 4` after each TODO.
